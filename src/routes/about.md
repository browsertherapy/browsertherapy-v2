# About {siteTitle}
Our goal is to treat code as a tool for self expression and creativity. In our weekly live stream we use hands-on web projects involving art, design, games to present programming in an engaging way.

Check us out if you want to:
- Escape the real world with a new hobby;
- Master the craft of web programming;
- Learn how to code more consistently in your free time;
- Learn how to bring a project from idea to reality;
- Watch Tony scream at his monitor from time to time.
