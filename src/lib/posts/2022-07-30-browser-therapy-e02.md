## Agenda for this week
1. King of Tokyo Recap
    - A reminder of why you're spending a Saturday afternoon online.
2. Walk-through of last week
3. Simple dice faces with Font Awesome (maybe custom SVG?)
    - The current design is non-existent. Gotta make it pretty!
4. Dark Mode (i.e. Dark Edition)
    - The whole game will support different themes in light and dark modes. We might as well start with the dice.
5. Plan out a new roll interface
    - Let's fix some problems with the way our dice roller looks and behaves.
