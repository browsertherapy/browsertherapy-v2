## What is Browser Therapy
### Goals
1. Have fun and escape!
    - First series will be building a board game.
2. Be accountable to yourself and code regularly.
    - Weekly episodes are scheduled so we stick with the process.
3. Master your craft.
    - How we code is more important than what we code.
