## Topics covered
- Shuffling a deck of cards using the [Fisher–Yates algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)
- Dealing and discarding cards with:
    - `Array.prototype.pop()`
    - `Array.prototype.push()`

## Housekeeping
- We've created a new project repo:
    - [king-of-tokyo-clone](https://github.com/browsertherapy/king-of-tokyo-clone/)
    - [Live Demo](https://browsertherapy.github.io/king-of-tokyo-clone/)

## Agenda for this week
1. Weekly Journal Review
    - [Code Journal](https://acidtone.github.io/code-journal/)
    - [Teaching Journal](https://acidtone.github.io/teaching-journal/)
2. Walk-through of last week
3. King of Tokyo Recap, focusing on the cards
4. Walk-through of the [Fisher–Yates algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)
    - Random permutations are tight!
4. Shuffling a deck of cards as an array of objects:
    - See: 
        - Stack Overflow: [How to randomize (shuffle) a JavaScript array](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array)
        - [Cool visualizations of different techniques](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/)
5. Deal 3 cards face-up with `Array.prototype.pop()` and `Array.prototype.push()`.
6. Buy a "Discard" card.
    - Deal a card face-up to replace bought/discarded card.
    - Move card to discard pile.
7. Sweep all three face-up cards.
